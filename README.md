## Description

AnimeGuessr is an interactive web-based anime guessing game where users can test their knowledge of popular anime characters. Players are presented with images of characters and must guess their names within a set number of rounds.

The game pulls anime data and images dynamically from the Jikan API, offering a fresh experience each time it is played. The project uses Node.js, Express, and EJS for the server-side and rendering logic, while leveraging Bootstrap and jQuery for a responsive and interactive front-end.

Key Features:
    Dynamic Image Selection: Randomized anime images are fetched from the Jikan API.
    Interactive Gameplay: Players can select categories and number of rounds before starting the game.
    Responsive Design: The website is designed to be mobile-friendly and works well across devices.
